Steps to sanity check the server or one of its mirrors.

- Run searches
  - Word that should be found
  - Word that should return more than ten results ("copil")
  - Word that doesn't exist and should return approximate matches
  - Word that doesn't exist and shouldn't return any approximate matches
  - Regexp that should return some matches. Verify that scrolling through
    pages is fast due to caching.
  - Regexp that should not return any matches.
  - Incorrect regexp like ma[ -- should print an error.
- You should only have access to /download/mirrorAccess from the IPs of the
  known mirrors.
