- dropped the htmlize.cc server
- conversions are now done in PHP
- started using Unicode
- DB stores definitions in both the internal format and the HTML (ready to
  display) format.
- When the user types in a definition, we convert all the shorthand notations
  to Unicode and convert all the references (empty/minus references). Then
  we compute and save the HTML definition.
- When the admin modifies a definition, we recompute the internal format and
  the HTML format.
